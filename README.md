# CCSM's ToDo

## Issues we ran into 
 - Our first issue was just trying to get our test suite off the ground. We had run ``` npm i ``` and had even written tests and nothing was working. Our problem was we hadn't opened up the **package.json** and added the following:
    ``` 
    "scripts": {
    "test": "tape test.js | tap-spec"
    }
    ``` 
 - Another hurdle was figuring out how to call functions that had been defined in logic.js, when we were in our test.js file. The clue was in 
 ``` var logic = require('./logic.js'); ``` 
 and that we needed to call ``` logic.function``` and not ``` todosFunction.function ``` since the logic.js file was exporting the todosFunction object - the magic is ``` module.exports = todoFunctions; ```. 
- An overall issue for us was just reading and understanding the **existing codebase** - particularly when functions were being passed around between different files.

- In loads of cases, we started writing code that had already been hinted at, or even fully provided for us.
- **In fact**, we forgot about the functions that we wrote in logic.js, and starting trying to write that functionality directly into the dom.js... which caused a lot of problems.
- Secondly, we were focusing on manipulating the existing array ``` state ```, instead of applying the functions we had forgotten about.

## Lessons learnt 
- **READ THE CODEBASE COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!!!**
- We could have saved ourselves a lot of headaches, time and confusion if we had taken time to read to the bottom of the file, and realise that the skeleton had already done a lot of the work for us.

## What we're proud of 
- Scrapping our dom.js file and starting from scratch at 5.30pm and not completely going off the rails (thanks Eve).

- All **git** stuff went pretty smoothly!
- In our first week project we didn't pair very well, and ending up splitting up into teams. This time we were all sharing what we were doing better, and just working better as a team really!
- Even though we could definitely have initially written more tests/covered more edge cases, we wrote **failing tests** that we then got to **pass**.
- Sweet **CSS**.

## Stretch goals
 - We wrote our **markToDo** function, but it'd be good to fully **test it**, and then **implement it for the user** (i.e strikeout or different colour for completed tasks).
 - Write the sortToDo function and implement.
 - It'd be cool to enter multiple todos in the same input, separated by commas or semi-colons, for example.
