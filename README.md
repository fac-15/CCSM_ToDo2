# CCSM_ToDo2

## Issues we ran into 
 - package.json: putting 'tape test.js | tap-spec' in 
    "scripts": {
    "test": "tape test.js | tap-spec"
    }
 - this meant our test suite didn't get off the ground for quite a while!
 - Reading and understanding an existing codebase.
 - In loads of cases, we started writing code that had already been provided for us.

## Lessons learnt 
- READ THE CODEBASE COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!!!
- We could have saved ourselves a lot of headaches, time and confusion if we had taken time to read to the bottom of the file, and realise that the skeleton had already done a lot of the work for us.

## What we're proud of 
- All git stuff went pretty smoothly!
- Even though we could definitely have initially written more/covered more edge cases, we wrote failing tests that we then got to pass.
- Scrapping our dom.js file and starting from scratch at 5.30pm and not having a meltdown (just about)

## Stretch goals
